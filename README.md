# qi_scraper
Web scraper specifically to pull transcripts of all QI episodes and format them into a nice neat json file in order to create training data for a character level RNN that will learn to speak like Stephen Fry

Thanks to the people at https://sites.google.com/site/qitranscripts/transcripts for their hard work in transcribing the episodes.
Created this script so i could do a single swipe at their site and not repeatedly hammer it.
